# HealthRAG
To enhance the identification of false health information and provide professional health guidance, this paper proposes HealthRAGâ€”a false health information detection system based on **Large Language Models** (LLMs) and **dual-path extraction** technology, aiming to improve the accuracy and credibility of misinformation identification. The system constructs a knowledge graph using **NetWorkX** and employs **ColbertV2** as the semantic retriever for dual-path knowledge extraction, utilizing 33 professional books as the knowledge base. Evaluation was conducted using 134 positive and 298 negative examples, comparing HealthRAG against several advanced LLMs. The proposed model achieved an accuracy of **94.68%** and an F1-Score of **91.14%**, representing a **2.85%** improvement in F1-Score over the best-performing LLM-only baseline. The results fully demonstrate that Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology effectively mitigates LLM hallucinations, achieving a substantial breakthrough in false health information detection.
